    composition:
      principles:
        - "Forward movement: diagonal compositions suggesting progress"
        - "Human-centric: people in authentic work moments, not posed"
        - "Context-rich: show real ProRail infrastructure environments"
        - "Optimistic framing: look towards future, not backward"
        - "Connection: subjects integrated in larger rail network/mission context"

      whitespace: "Medium-High - balance between dynamic content and professional breathing space"

      framing:
        preferred: "Dynamic thirds composition; subjects positioned for forward movement (left to right or bottom-left to top-right progression)"
        avoid: "Dead-center symmetrical framing (too static); extreme off-center (unstable feeling)"

      subject_scale: "Medium to large subjects with environmental context visible"

      camera_angles:
        preferred:
          - "Eye-level (human perspective, approachable)"
          - "Slight low-angle (aspirational, empowering, forward-looking)"
          - "Wide environmental (showing scale of infrastructure and mission)"
          - "Detail/close-up (technical precision, craftsmanship, pride in work)"
        avoid:
          - "Extreme high angles (diminishing, distant)"
          - "Dramatic dutch angles (chaotic, unstable - conflicts with reliability)"

        primary: "Human subjects OR key message"
        secondary: "Rail infrastructure environment providing context"
        tertiary: "ProRail Red accents (logo, graphic elements) anchoring composition"

    lighting:
      intent: "Natural, authentic, optimistic. Lighting should feel real and honest, never overly staged or artificial."

        - "Soft natural daylight (outdoor rail environments, golden hour warmth)"
        - "Warm professional indoor lighting (workshops, offices, control rooms)"
        - "Dawn/dusk light (aspirational, forward-looking, optimistic)"
        - "Clean diffused studio light for portraits (professional but not cold)"

      avoid:
        - "Harsh overhead fluorescent (unflattering, depressing)"
        - "Cold blue-toned lighting (conflicts with warm optimistic brand)"
        - "Overly dramatic shadows (noir aesthetic inappropriate)"
        - "Flash photography (candid feel preferred)"

      shadow_behavior: "Present but diffused; adds depth and dimension without harshness"

      color_temperature: "Slightly warm (3500-5000K) to balance technical subject matter and create welcoming feeling"

    photography_style:
      overall_approach: "Documentary realism meets employer brand aspiration. Show real ProRail people doing real work in authentic environments, captured with professional polish but never losing honesty."

      image_treatment:
        color_grade: "Natural with slight warmth; authentic not hyper-processed"
        saturation: "True-to-life; don't oversaturate (maintain documentary honesty)"
        contrast: "Medium-high; crisp and clear but not harsh"
        sharpness: "High for technical/infrastructure subjects; slightly softer for human moments"

      application:
        digital: "SVG format, scalable, accessible with proper ARIA labels"
        print: "Vector format, reproducible at any size"

    illustration_style:
      when_to_use: "Sparingly - only when photography cannot convey concept (abstract ideas, technical diagrams, process flows)"

      approach: "Geometric, precise, technical. Illustrations should feel like technical drawings or infographics, not decorative art."

      characteristics:
        style: "Clean vector-based, technical diagram aesthetic"
        palette: "ProRail Red, White, Tundora only"
