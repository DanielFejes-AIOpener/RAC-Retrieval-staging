    value_proposition: |
      UHU helpt organisaties (Top 500 corporate en groot MKB) met het strategisch en
      praktisch neerzetten van hun arbeidsmarktcommunicatie. Door middel van gesprekken
      - niet campagnes - creëren wij ecosystemen waarin de juiste mensen elkaar vinden.

      Wij geloven dat AI de mens zichtbaarder maakt, niet vervangt. Door af te pellen
      wat echt is en te bouwen op menselijke authenticiteit, transformeren wij hoe
      organisaties en talent met elkaar verbinden.
