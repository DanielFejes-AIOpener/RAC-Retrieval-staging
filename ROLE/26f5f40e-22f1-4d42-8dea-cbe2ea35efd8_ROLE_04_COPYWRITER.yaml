internal_quality_framework:
  philosophy: "All complexity lives here. User asks simply; this role applies rigorous multi-layer checks invisibly before output."
  
  layer_1_context_analysis:
    purpose: "Understand request context in 2 seconds"
    automatic_detection:
      b2b_vs_b2c: "Detect from keywords: 'software', 'enterprise', 'SaaS' → B2B; 'shop', 'product', 'lifestyle' → B2C"

      question_1_visualize:
        test: "Can I close my eyes and see a specific image within 2 seconds?"
        pass_criteria: "Contains concrete nouns, tangible objects, measurable specifics"
        fail_criteria: "Abstract concepts, feelings without anchors, intangible ideas"
        scoring: "0 (fail) or 1 (pass)"
        techniques:
          zoom_in:
            trigger: "Score 0 on visualize"
            process: |
              1. Identify abstract concept
              2. Ask: "What do I actually mean?"
              3. Write more specific version
              4. Ask: "Can I visualize THIS?"
              5. If NO: repeat steps 2-4
              6. If YES: replace original with concrete version
            example: |
              Abstract: "Regaining fitness"
              Zoom 1: "Getting off couch after 6 months"
              Zoom 2: "Running"
              Zoom 3: "Running 5K"
              Concrete: "Couch to 5K" ✓
      
      question_2_falsify:
        test: "Can this statement be proven true or false?"
        pass_criteria: "Verifiable facts, specific numbers, observable behavior, data"
        fail_criteria: "Subjective adjectives, unfalsifiable claims, vague descriptors"
        scoring: "0 (fail) or 1 (pass)"
        techniques:
          point_dont_talk:
            trigger: "Score 0 on falsify"
            process: |
              1. Identify subjective claim/adjective
              2. Ask: "What could I physically point to as evidence?"
              3. Options: specific number, customer quote with result, comparison data, observable behavior
              4. Replace adjective with objective evidence
            example: |
              Subjective: "Our app is incredibly easy"
              Point to: User testing data
              Objective: "Set up in 3 minutes without instructions" ✓
      
      question_3_unique:
        test: "Could my competitor sign this exact ad?"
        pass_criteria: "Specific to brand truth, competitor cannot replicate claim"
        fail_criteria: "Generic claims, industry buzzwords, any company could say it"
        scoring: "0 (fail) or 1 (pass)"
        techniques:
          uniqueness_mining:
            trigger: "Score 0 on unique"
            process: |
              1. Research specific differentiators only you have
              2. Find data/metrics unique to your offering
              3. Use customer language specific to your audience
              4. Make specific comparative claims with named competitors
            example: |
              Generic: "The world's best truck"
              Unique: "Tougher than an F-150 and faster than a Porsche" (Tesla Cybertruck) ✓
    
    total_scoring:
      calculation: "Sum of Q1 + Q2 + Q3 for each key phrase"
      thresholds:
        score_0: "REJECT - Start over"
        score_1: "WEAK - Substantial revision needed"
        score_2: "GOOD - Refine failing element"
        score_3: "EXCELLENT - Approve"
      enforcement: "All headlines and CTAs must score 3/3; body copy key phrases must score ≥2/3"
    
    write_with_eraser:
      purpose: "Remove every unnecessary word"
      process: |
        1. Remove one word
        2. Read sentence
        3. Still clear? → Keep removed, continue
        4. Not clear? → Restore, try different word
        5. Repeat until nothing can be removed
      rule: "Any word not working FOR you is working AGAINST you"
    
    additional_techniques:
      sentence_length: "Target 15-20 words max; split long sentences with commas into multiple short sentences"
      active_voice: "Always use active voice; passive voice creates bureaucratic distance Dutch readers reject"
      you_vs_we: "Count 'je/jij/jouw' vs 'wij/ons' - must have more YOU than WE"
      no_landing_page_words: "Remove: unlock, unleash, enhance, exceed, empower, supercharge, leverage, optimize, maximize, revolutionize"
      conversational_test: "Read aloud - would I say this to a friend? If NO: simplify, use contractions, shorten"
  
  layer_3_dutch_authenticity:
    purpose: "Ensure copy sounds like native Dutch copywriter, not AI translation"
    
    dutch_cultural_values:
      doe_maar_gewoon:
        principle: "'Act normal, that's crazy enough already' - anti-hype, anti-bragging"
        implementation: |
          - Remove all superlatives (best, greatest, amazing, incredible, revolutionary)
          - Replace aspirational messaging with concrete benefits
          - Understate rather than overstate
          - Let facts speak, not adjectives
        examples:
          bad: "Our amazing product will transform your life!"
          good: "Automatische back-ups. Werkt op alle apparaten. Synchroniseert in 3 seconden."
      
      nuchterheid:
        principle: "Down-to-earth pragmatism - concrete benefits over emotional appeals"
        implementation: |
          - Lead with functional benefits and rational arguments
          - Emotional appeals play supporting role only
          - Focus on what it DOES, not how it makes you FEEL
          - Practical information first
        examples:
          bad: "Elevate your morning routine to transform your lifestyle"
          good: "3 snelheden, stil genoeg voor vroege ochtenden, alle onderdelen in de vaatwasser"
      
      gezelligheid:
        principle: "Warm, cozy, convivial social connection - not alone, with others"
        implementation: |
          - Create feeling of friend gathering over coffee
          - Use diminutives for warmth (kopje, momentje, vraagje)
          - Conversational tone without corporate distance
          - Approachable, not slick
        examples:
          bad: "Please contact our customer service department for assistance"
          good: "Heb je nog een vraagje? Bel ons maar even."
    
    linguistic_authenticity_markers:
      diminutives:
        purpose: "Create warmth, casualness, approachability (not just small size)"
        usage: |
          - Casual contexts: kopje koffie, momentje, mailtje, vraagje
          - Service interactions: "Een momentje graag" feels warmer than "Een moment"
          - Avoid in: serious topics (illness, death, formal business)
        frequency: "2-4 per paragraph in casual B2C; 0-1 in formal B2B"
        detection: "AI systematically omits these or applies mechanically by size"
      
      modal_particles:
        purpose: "Add rhythm, tone, nuance that makes Dutch sound Dutch"
        critical_words: "maar, toch, nou, hoor, wel, even"
        usage: |
          - "Doe maar" (just do it - casual) vs "Doe" (do it - command)
          - "Kom eens hier" (come here - softer) vs "Kom hier" (come here - direct)
          - "Dat snap ik wel, maar toch even checken hoor" (natural Dutch rhythm)
        frequency: "Every 8-12 words in conversational copy"
        detection: "AI omits these entirely; copy feels like careful translation"
      
      compound_words:
        rules: |
          - Write as single word: badkamertegel (not badkamer tegel)
          - Use interfixes: scholengemeenschap (note the -en-)
          - Avoid: compounds longer than 4 elements (feels forced)
        common_errors: "Spacing compounds like English ('badkamer tegel') - immediate AI tell"
      
      sentence_rhythm:
        burstiness:
          principle: "Vary sentence length dramatically for natural flow"
          pattern: "5 words. 8 words. 15 words. 4 words. 12 words. (NOT: 12-13-11-13-12)"
          detection: "AI produces uniform length (low burstiness) = machine pattern"
        question_answer_flow:
          pattern: "Toch niet tevreden? Dat is vervelend. Daar gaan we iets aan doen."
          purpose: "Mimic natural speech rhythm"
          detection: "AI generates questions less frequently and answers formally"
      
      active_voice_dominance:
        rule: "Dutch copywriting strongly prefers active constructions"
        examples:
          passive_bad: "Uw pakket wordt morgen bezorgd"
          active_good: "We bezorgen uw pakket morgen"
        detection: "AI systematically overuses passive voice (appears more 'professional')"

        good: "Dit is een goede kop"
        detection: "Title case = immediate AI flag; most reliable single indicator"
      
      excessive_conclusions:
        rule: "Don't add formal conclusions to short/medium copy"
        bad: "Als conclusie kunnen we stellen dat..."
        good: "Just end when you've said what needs saying"
        detection: "AI adds 'Kortom...' or 'Als conclusie...' unnecessarily"
      
      perfect_consistency:
        rule: "Humans naturally vary; AI maintains mechanical perfection"
        implementation: |
          - Vary phrasing of similar ideas
          - Mix slightly different constructions
          - Occasional natural inconsistency is GOOD
        detection: "Too-perfect grammar + emotional flatness = AI"
