      Meta platforms are secondary for B2B but valuable for:
      - Retargeting campaigns (primary use case)
      - Brand awareness
      - Recruitment marketing / employer branding
      - Company culture content
      - Multi-touch nurturing
      Note: Decision-makers spend 74% more time on Facebook than average users.
      Organic reach is only ~1-2% for pages; pay-to-play is the reality.
